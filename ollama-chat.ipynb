These additional sources of data would advance the study’s findings with \\ngreater evidence and robustness in support of recommendations and CDRL best practices.     \\nThe literature review focused on representative examples of CDRL use.

Once a DoD PO and a prime contractor agree to the list of deliverables (CDRLs), \\nthe list becomes part of a binding contract.  CDRLs document the data items and information the \\nPO wants the contractor to provide, aligned with the terms of the contract.  A CDRL both assists \\nand protects PO’s and contractors in the execution of a defense contract.  Managing the use and \\neffectiveness of CDRLs on a contract can be cumbersome and complex.  Misunderstandings or \\nmismanagement of CDRLs can lead to schedule delays, cost overruns or system performance \\ndisputes (ACQ-1, 2019).  This paper examines the best practices and common features a DoD \\nPO and a defense contractor should consider when managing CDRLs.  The research identifies \\ncommon shortcomings in current practices and recommends ‘Best Practices’ and techniques to \\nimprove outcomes.'),\n",
